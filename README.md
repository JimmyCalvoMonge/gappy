### Anomaly detection in numeric data

- Suppose we have a numeric matrix and we are interested in simple signals (this means 2D variable combinations, for example) in which data anomalies are detected, being the most expected case variables with a non normal multivariate distribution or with clear clusters or gaps.

- We do some testing with blob detection algorithms (instead of the usual cluster and silhouette score approach) and propose an algorithm to find these abnormaly distributed combinations of variables.

- TODO: extend to multiple dimension combinations (not just 2D) and check some inconsistencies in some weird data cases.

JCM.
